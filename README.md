Transaction at the Repository Level 


## Approach: Transaction at the Repository Level (BeginTransaction Method)

Here, each repository has its own BeginTransaction method, and the service manages the transaction by passing the transaction context to the repositories.

`Pros`:

- Granularity: Allows fine-grained control over transactions, enabling different repositories to manage their own transactions.
- Direct Control: Gives the service layer direct control over the transaction process, which can be useful in certain scenarios.

`Cons`:
- Code Duplication: Each repository needs to implement its own transaction management logic, leading to potential code duplication.
- Complexity: Increases the complexity of the service layer, as it must coordinate transaction management across multiple repositories.
Risk of Inconsistency: Higher risk of inconsistencies if the transaction context is not managed properly across repositories.

`Best Practice`:

This approach is less common in Hexagonal Architecture because it mixes concerns and adds complexity. It's usually better to centralize transaction management rather than spreading it across repositories.
Suitable only in cases where each repository truly needs its own independent transaction management.
